            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Londons new Recorder: Or, certain Queres to
be reſolved by the old Recorder, for Londons further welfare.</head>
            <p>1. WHether the Cities late furious and audacious inſolence in liſting themſelves and ingaging their friends for a ſecond War, or
their tame and ſhamefull ſubmiſſion and betraying the others, be more worthy of contempt.</p>
            <p>2. Whether we may not now as juſtly and ingenuouſly covenant to endeavour the extirpation of the chief Officers in the City-Government,
whether it be the Lord Mayor, Alderman, Sheriffes Common-Counſell, and other Officers depending thereon, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
better in their room, for their late intended rebellion in raiſing a new Warre, as they before have the extirpation of Popery, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy,
(that is Church-Government by Archbiſhops, Biſhops, Chancellors, Deanes, &amp;c.) Superſtition, Hereſie, Schiſme, Prophaneneſſe,
&amp;c. theſe being ſins more apparantly, acted by them, and we more miſerably ſenſible thereof, then theſe of the latter; none of which
the whole Synod can yet reduce under any of their Claſſes.</p>
            <p>3. Whether the City-Fomenters in their late practices for a new warre, did not give occaſion, and it be not more juſtice and leſſe Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge
for the King and State to appropriate to themſelves theſe Caupon Capon-eaters, Halls and ſeverall Corporations, the maine
incentive of their pride and rebellion, then thoſe ancient and pious fabricks and endowments of our fore-fathers devotion and charity.</p>
            <p>4. Whether theſe new holy daies of Apprentices and School-boyes may not prove a greater deformation to Church and City, then
their ancient Shrovetide and May-day hath been of Reformation to Play-houſes and Stewes.</p>
            <p>5. Whether the redoubted valour of the Apprentices hath not revived their extinguiſht birth-right, and made more Gentlemen
then Maſters: who as they had done the King from the Parliament, ſo theſe ſhall extrude their Maſters from their Commodities and
Ware-houſes.</p>
            <p>6. Whether it be not as neceſſary for the temporall Sword to ſuppreſſe all Armes and Souldiery of the City, as it is for the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall,
all Schiſme and Sectaries, they both having their beginning in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time, and both alike formidably increaſed to
Church and State.</p>
            <p>7. Whether Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> firſt licenſe to a few Citizens and Apprentices, may not exerciſe Armes for her diſport and entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
may not be re-called by her Succeſſor, their number now being limited and their uſe <hi>è diametro</hi> to the contrary.</p>
            <p>8. Whether ſince their expulſion of the King from his Chamber the City, and their diſloyall royall hunt, they would not now
though againſt their Religion and Charter, turne penitent Pilgrims and reviſit S. <hi>Cutberts</hi> and S. <hi>Michaels</hi> Mount to reduce him and
the Prince, and although they have not canonized any of them for a Saint in their weekly Pamphlet, yet for his returne to procure a
new holy day Ordinance, and Regiſter it in their yearly Kalenders.</p>
            <p>9. Whether that ancient little Modell the City (not circumſcribed now in the Lines of Communication) hath not by their tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
Petitions reduced and whitled that maine prop and poſt of our Engliſh Government (the Parliament) to leſſe power and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
then a Sheriffes white rod, or a Conſtables painted ſtaffe.</p>
            <p>10. Whether their long Liberties over Southwark, Weſtminſter, White-Chappell, &amp;c. hath not made thoſe places greater ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of feare and danger unto the City her ſelfe, then they have made her to be of terrour to the whole Kingdome: And whether
like an over-growne Oyſter, doth ſhe not now ſtew in her owne pickell.</p>
            <p>11. Whether the City do not deale with its Suburbs and their Line of Communication, as the Jewes of old with the Samaritans,
acknowledge them brethren onely while they advantage them: And whether, if neceſſarily they muſt be Appendices, they ought not
to communicate in all its Liberties.</p>
            <p>12. Whether thoſe Marſhall Burgeſſes have not good nigh brought their City into as calamituous a caſe as they would have
done S. <hi>Peters</hi> patrimony or the Biſhops eſtates.</p>
            <p>13. Whether the City monopolizing all Trades, it be a good ſtate of body, to have a fat head, thin guts, and leane members:
Or whether it be not expedient policy by launcing the mids of the hide, to eventilate thoſe tumors, which by the late depreſſing and
trampling of the ſides hath ſo exorbitantly ſwelled there, that it holds not now a fit proportion for the right levell of the whole.</p>
            <p>14. Whether their endeavorring to make themſelves a fourth party and eſtate of the Kingdome, and having (with the earthen
pot in the fable) juſtled with all the other, and now downe ſtream they bee not likely to be ſhattered a pieces by the others greater
ſtrength.</p>
            <p>15. Whereas upon the 7. of this Auguſt the City gave up its ſpirit inarticulately inteſtate, whether his Excellency, their preſent
Adminiſtrator, will yet accept of their beaten gold Baſon, and Ewer, and permit their wives and children, according to their cuſtome
to enjoy their third parts.</p>
            <p>16. Whether the City-tame Pidgeons ſince their late wild flight, abandoning their Turtells, will not moſt of them be transform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to Stockdoves, and ſeeke ſome deſert or wilderneſſe to bemoan their unpittied deſolation.</p>
            <p>17. Whether the Cockneigh or the Horſe-crow be now the more proper and pleaſing language to a Citizen.</p>
            <p>18. VVhether on the Royall Exchange, the Publike-Faith, or the Iriſh Purchaſer will prove the greater Bankrupts.</p>
            <p>19. Whether Alderman <hi>Greſham</hi> in his Trunk-hoſe and round Cap upon the Exchange deſerveth not (though he leſſe need) more
incenſe to his memorie and is more worthy their imitation, then lately that Rhodomontado Alderman in Moorfieles on horſe-back
with all his capariſons.</p>
            <p>20. Whether the Old Change and Guild-hall are not neerer to Newgate and Ludgate, then the Biſhops gate be unto the Tower</p>
            <p>21. Whether Britaines Burſs be not now as rich as Gold-ſmiths or Guild-hall.</p>
            <p>22. Whether Bedlame and Bridewell ſound not better to Puritan then S. <hi>Bartholomewes</hi> or Chriſt-Church.</p>
            <p>23. Whether Pater Noſter Row Ave and Creeds Lane ſtood not as neer Cheapſide-Croſſe as Gracious ſtreet.</p>
            <p>24. Whether <hi>Lex talionis</hi> in all things hath not yet met with the City; and whether to this Quinteſſence of all their former Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and <hi>adaequate</hi> tranſcendent puniſhment may not juſtly be feared.</p>
            <p>25. Whether the old Recorder ſhall not be better imployed in ſtaying here to reſolve all theſe Quaeres, then his other ten fellow-Members
hath been in giving occaſions to raiſe them, and then running away.</p>
